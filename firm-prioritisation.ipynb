    "A Supervision Manager has asked you to help in allocating scarce resources, and identify which firms their team should focus on. Supervisory resource may be allocated according to the following characteristics: \n",
    "* Firm size (i.e. the biggest firms need more attention) \n",
    "* Changing business profile (are firms’ data changing substantially year-on-year?) \n",
    "* Outliers from the norm (when looking at a single reporting period, does a firm deviate significantly from the average?) \n",
    "\n",
    "Some typical metrics have been provided in the attached data sheets. These include: \n",
    "* Gross Written Premium (GWP) – total revenue written by an insurer. Equivalent of turnover for a non-insurance firm. \n",
    "* Net Written Premium (NWP) – GWP less reinsurance. NWP / GWP will show how much of the firm’s risk is being passed on to reinsurers. \n",
    "* SCR coverage ratio – a measure of whether a firm is meeting its prudential capital requirements. Greater than 100% means the firm is holding enough capital to meet the requirement. The size of the buffer (i.e. surplus over 100%) can be important. \n",
    "* Gross claims incurred – a large cost to an insurer. Monitoring how these change over time for a firm is vital. \n",
    "* Net combined ratio – (incurred losses plus expenses) / earned premiums. This is a ratio that can indicate the profitability of a firm. If this is less than 100% it indicates a profit. \n",
